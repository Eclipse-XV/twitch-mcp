Context:
We have a feature branch feature-slash-npm-restore-merge that fixes npm/restore issues. main is currently messy (I broke it earlier). Glamour.ai (glamour.ai) is currently failing to load — leave a TODO to investigate later. The next target for a manual deploy by me (human) is Smithery; I will manually deploy whatever ends up in main. Smithery currently requires a lazy authorization feature which is not yet implemented; expect the Smithery deploy to fail until lazy auth is added.

Goal:
Conservatively merge feature-slash-npm-restore-merge into main, run a full local/CI verification pipeline (build, lint, test), create a PR and only auto-merge if all checks pass, push resulting main to origin, and stop. Do NOT deploy to Smithery or any production environment. Produce a clear report with next steps and an actionable issue for implementing lazy authorization for Smithery.

Constraints / safety:

Do not rewrite main history. No force pushes.

Create a backup branch of main before merging.

Prefer a PR + CI gating strategy over a raw forced merge; auto-merge only if CI passes.

Do not attempt any production deploys — user will deploy to Smithery manually.

Be conservative with changes; if any step is uncertain, fail safe and stop with instructions for human intervention.

Steps to perform (commands & checks):

Create a backup of main:

git fetch origin

git checkout origin/main -b backup/main-before-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

git push origin backup/main-before-merge-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)

Sync branches:

git checkout main

git pull origin main

git checkout feature-slash-npm-restore-merge

git pull origin feature-slash-npm-restore-merge

Local verification on the feature branch:

Run dependency restore: npm ci (or yarn install --frozen-lockfile if repo uses yarn — detect automatically; if unknown, run npm ci then fallback)

Build: npm run build (fail if not present, report location of build script)

Lint: npm run lint (if available)

Tests: npm test (or npm run test:ci if found)

If any step fails, stop and output the failing command, error output, and suggested fixes. Do not merge.

Create a PR (preferred safe path):

From feature-slash-npm-restore-merge -> main

PR title: chore: merge feature-slash-npm-restore-merge — npm restore fixes

PR body: include summary of changes, CI status required, mention Glamour.ai is flaky and Smithery needs lazy auth (see TODOs below).

Set required reviewers or assignees if repository has CODEOWNERS.

Trigger CI; wait for all checks.

If CI passes and only then, merge to main:

Merge strategy: create a merge commit (no fast-forward) to preserve history.

git checkout main

git merge --no-ff feature-slash-npm-restore-merge -m "Merge branch 'feature-slash-npm-restore-merge' into main — npm restore fixes"

git push origin main

If the repo has policy requiring PR-only merges, perform the merge via the PR UI/API instead of local merge.

After pushing main:

Build an artifact that the human can use to deploy to Smithery (e.g., npm run build output packaged into artifact.tar.gz). Save path and sha256.

DO NOT deploy. Instead report: branch merged, artifact ready, and that user (human) will deploy to Smithery manually.

If any step fails:

Capture logs, stack traces, failing commands.

Create a GitHub/GitLab issue in the repo with:

Title: deploy-blocker: failure merging feature-slash-npm-restore-merge -> main (automated report)

Body: include error logs, commands run, and recommended next steps.

Stop and hand off to the user with exact reproduction commands.

Smithery-specific notes (what to prepare for manual deploy):

Expect deploy to fail due to missing lazy authorization. Do not attempt to bypass authorization.

Checklist for human deploy to Smithery:

Ensure env variables/secrets for Smithery are up-to-date on the server.

Confirm Node version and system packages match CI.

Upload packaged build artifact and run the Smithery startup script.

Watch Smithery logs for auth or authorization errors — these indicate the lazy auth issue.

If it fails, capture logs and link to the lazy auth issue (below).

Conservative suggestions for implementing Lazy Authorization (create issue + developer pointers):

Create an issue titled: feature: lazy authorization for Smithery

Issue body (suggested text to include):

Problem: Smithery requires a lazy authorization flow (defer token exchange until first protected request) which is not implemented, causing runtime failures on deploy.

Requirements:

Add a feature-flagged middleware that checks an optional lazyAuth=true setting.

If lazy auth enabled, allow unauthenticated initialization steps and only trigger full token exchange on the first request that touches protected resources.

Add integration tests: simulate initial unauthenticated startup and then first request that triggers the auth flow.

Add unit tests for the middleware and fallback for expired tokens.

Document env vars and migration steps needed for rollout.

Suggested implementation files/areas to touch: auth middleware / server bootstrap / token exchange service.

Rollout plan: feature-flag behind SMITHERY_LAZY_AUTH=true, test in staging, then enable in production.

Glamour.ai note (leave a TODO):

glamour.ai is currently failing to load. Create a short issue/prioritized todo: investigate glamour.ai loading errors that includes:

Snapshot of response when hitting the site (HTTP status, timing)

Check CDN / DNS / ingress logs

Check recent deploys and rollbacks

Assign to the Glamour team or tag appropriate maintainers

Do not attempt to fix Glamour now — just log the issue and mark as high priority.

Output to produce at the end (what I want you to return to me):

Clear summary: whether merge happened or not.

Exact commands you ran and outputs (logs). If you stopped, explain why and include logs.

Link to created PR and issue(s) (lazy auth + glamour.ai) or full issue text if creating via CLI is not available.

Path to the packaged build artifact and its checksum.

Recommended next steps and a short rollback plan in case Smithery deploy breaks.

Small conservative reminders for Claude Code:

If any step requires elevated permissions (repo settings, protected branch bypass), do not do it; stop and report.

If uncertain between npm vs yarn or pnpm, try npm ci first. If lockfile indicates yarn.lock or pnpm-lock.yaml, prefer the corresponding tool and report which one was used.

If repository uses monorepo tools (lerna, turborepo), run repository-detected build commands (e.g., turbo run build) instead of naive npm run build. If detection cannot be automated, fail safe and ask the human.

Deliverables:

PR created (URL) or merge commit (sha) pushed to main.

Backup branch created (name).

lazy authorization issue created (URL or full issue text).

glamour.ai TODO issue created (URL or full issue text).

Build artifact path + checksum.

Final human-facing summary and next steps for manual Smithery deploy.
